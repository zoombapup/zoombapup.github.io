							<h1 class="major">Personal Statement</h1>
							<p>During the course of my research, I've become painfully aware of the potential for negative uses of technology as it advances. How do we deal with disinformation as a society where we cannot trust any form of media as it may be procedurally generated to manipulate us?</p>
							<p>I believe the ethics of media creators, including those who empower them through research, should be carefully scrutinized, but in the end, I admit that my curiosity about how the world works is more powerful than my ethical qualms. Having said that, I do think that one way to balance the weight of the ethics dilemma, is to both educate and advance the state of understanding for others to inform themselves. To this end, my aim as a researcher is not to gain enrichment for myself solely, but instead to share in a community of understanding. It with this in mind that I act to establish open-source alternatives to proprietary methods wherever I can legally do so. I hope that you, the reader of this statement, will join me in this community of understanding and seek to inform yourself of all the benefits and dangers ahead.</p>
