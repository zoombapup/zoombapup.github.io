							<h1 class="major">Generative Models and Procedural Content</h1>
							<p>In my videogame work, I was always fascinated by procedural content generation methods. With the invention of Deep Learning and new models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's) we can begin to address new content generation approaches.</p>
							<p>This aspect of my work involves understanding aspects such as computational creativity. Aesthetic judgement and how psychology can play a role in informing us about the different forms of "content". Naturally my primary interest is motion, but actually I've become obssessed with the generation of various content types such as 3D models as it feels like the gains to be had in this area are considerable and we have some good examples in the area of texture synthesis to go on.</p>
